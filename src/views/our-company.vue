                <li>Total transaction value represents the underwritten peak all-in cost of real estate investments included in offerings by Cadre since the formation of our Investment Committee (including realized investments).</li>
                <li>IRR calculation represents an equity weighted average annualized internal rate of return (IRR) for realized real estate investments of offerings by Cadre since the formation of our Investment Committee through to the date of calculation, after deduction of fees and expenses. Equity multiple represents the investment multiple on equity, which is calculated by dividing the aggregate realized proceeds for the applicable investment after deduction of fees and expenses. For recently realized investments, an estimate of proceeds to vehicles managed by Cadre may be used. The use of a different methodology may result in a materially different return metric.</li>
                <li>Gross distributions to investors refers to the sum of any income distributions, sale gains, and return of capital without deduction for any investor specific withholding or contribution interest. Distributions are not guaranteed. A portion of the gross distributions reflect a return of principal.</li>
